The code takes historical stock data and builds a graph showing how much time the stock has spent at different price levels. Recent prices are weighted more heavily using a time-decay factor, and the distribution is smoothed to create a continuous “landscape.” In the resulting plot, lower values on the y-axis correspond to price levels where the stock has spent more time, making them appear as “wells” or “valleys.” These valleys represent potentially more stable price levels, while peaks indicate less frequently visited prices.
